# Problem Statement: Write a program to solve this age-related riddle! Anton, Beth, Chen, Drew, and Ethan are all friends. Their ages are as follows:
# Anton is 21 years old.
# Beth is 6 years older than Anton.
# Chen is 20 years older than Beth.
# Drew is as old as Chen's age plus Anton's age.
# Ethan is the same age as Chen.
# Your code should store each person's age to a variable and print their names and ages at the end
anton_age : str = "21"
beth_age : str  = "anthon_age + 6"
chen_age : str = "beth_age + 20"
drew_age : str = "chen+age + anthon_age"
ethan_age : str = "chen_age"
